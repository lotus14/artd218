			<h3>RECIPE REVIEW</h3>
			<blockquote>"Won't be making these again. Realised halfway through that the recipe is for cups not shells so the ratios and cook times are off. When I filled my cooked shells, 3 out of 6 leaked filling all over the tray making them useless." - Jillian Jarosz Cremona July 31st, 2016</blockquote>

		<h2>4. Smoked Salmon &amp; Cream Cheese Éclairs</h2>
			<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
			<h4>For the Choux Pastry</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>70g plain flour</li>
				<li>1/2 tsp caster sugar</li>
				<li>Pinch salt</li>
				<li>65ml milk</li>
				<li>50g butter</li>
				<li>65ml water</li>
				<li>2 eggs</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>For the Filling</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>200g cream cheese</li>
				<li>1 tbsp horseradish sauce</li>
				<li>2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped</li>
				<li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
				<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
				<li>120g smoked salmon, cut into strips</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>To Garnish</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>12 small sprigs fresh dill</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>PREPARATION</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/Gas 7.</li>
				<li>To make the choux pastry, mix the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl. Gently heat the milk, butter and water in a saucepan so the butter melts but the liquid doesn’t bubble. Once the butter has melted, turn up the heat until the liquid starts to boil. Immediately turn off the heat, tip in the flour mixture and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough is formed.</li>
				<li>Spread the dough over a large dinner plate to cool to hand-hot, then scrape it back into the pan. Using a wooden spoon, beat in the eggs one at a time until you have a smooth, shiny mixture. Spoon into a piping bag with a 1cm hole snipped off or use a 1cm nozzle. Pipe the mixture into the éclair tray then place onto a baking tray and bake for 20-25 minutes, reducing the temperature to 200°C/Gas 6 as soon as the tray goes into the oven.</li>
				<li>Remove from the oven and split the éclairs down the middle with a small serrated knife, then return to the oven for 5 minutes until crisp and golden. Set aside to cool.</li>
				<li>Meanwhile, make the filling by mixing the cream cheese, horseradish, dill, lemon juice and seasoning in a bowl. Spoon into a piping bag with a 1cm hole snipped off. Once the mini éclairs have cooled completely, pipe the filling into them and top with strips of smoked salmon. Garnish with a small sprig of dill.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>NOTA BENE</h3>
			<p>The mini éclairs and cream cheese filling can be made a day in advance and kept in the fridge, the éclairs in an airtight container.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>6 oz (170 g) white chocolate, chopped</li>
			<li>2 cups (500 ml) 35% whipping cream</li>
			<li>1/2 lemon, grated zest only</li>
			<li>1 cup (250 g) mascarpone cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Crepes</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>1 1/2 cups (210 g) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>3 tbsp (40 g) sugar</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
		<li>3 eggs</li>
		<li>2 1/4 cups (560 ml) milk</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) vanilla extract</li>
		<li>Icing sugar, to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>PREPARATION</h3>
		<h4>White Chocolate Mascarpone Cream</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>In a bowl placed over a pot of simmering water or in a microwave oven, melt the white chocolate with 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the cream. Remove from the heat. Add the remaining cream (1 1/2 cups/375 ml) and the lemon zest. Stir well. </li>
			<li>Cover and refrigerate for about 3 hours or until the cream is cold.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Crepes</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the eggs, 1 cup (250 ml) of the milk and the vanilla. Stir with a whisk until smooth. Gradually stir in the remaining milk (1 1/4 cups/310 ml).</li>
			<li>In an 8-inch (20 cm) non-stick skillet brushed with butter over medium heat, cook the crepes, one at a time, using about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of batter per crepe. Cook until golden brown on both sides. Place the crepes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper as you go, until you have 16 crepes. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool completely.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Assembly</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Beat the white chocolate mixture and mascarpone with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
			<li>On a serving plate, place 1 crepe. With a spatula, spread the crepe with 1/3 cup of the white chocolate mascarpone cream. Cover with another crepe and spread with 1/3 cup of the cream. Repeat the sequence with the remaining ingredients to create 12 to 14 layers of crepes, using a crepe as the top layer. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.</li>
			<li>When ready to serve, dust with icing sugar. Serve with Raspberry Sauce (see recipe). The Mille Crepe Cake will keep for 1 day in the refrigerator.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>NOTA BENE</h3>
		<p>Using <strong>two</strong> skillets to prepare the crepes will cut down on your preparation time. The crepes may be made the day before assembling the cake.</p>

			</ol>
		<h3>RECIPE REVIEW</h3>
			<blockquote>"The texture and flavor were just like store bought ice cream. I added 2 tbsp of matcha and a 3rd yolk (as suggested by another user) and the matcha taste was nice and strong. This had the same matcha ice cream taste that I could get when I lived in Japan. We froze it to get it harder, but it never went rock hard, like most homemade ice creams get in the freezer, which is a huge plus. And I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it!" - deribou June 26th, 2016</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"Delicious. I recommend doubling the matcha powder for tea lovers and adding an extra egg yolk." - Julie Julie August 5th, 2015</blockquote>

		<h1>~Coffee &amp; Tea~</h1>
			<h2>1. Espresso</h2>
			<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1/2 cup ground coffee (French or other dark roast)</li>
				<li>1-1/2 cups cold water</li>
				<li>Lemon twists, optional</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>PREPARATION</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Place ground coffee in the filter of a drip coffeemaker. Add water; brew according to manufacturer's instructions. Serve immediately in espresso cups with lemon twists if desired. <strong>Yield: </strong>4 servings. </li>
			</ol>
			<h3>NOTA BENE</h3>
			<p>This recipe was tested with Starbucks French Roast ground coffee.</p>
			<h3>RECIPE REVIEW</h3>
			<blockquote>"Really good. I brew this on the stovetop (boil water, add coffee, pour through a reusable coffee filter over a pyrex cup), add 1/3 c sugar, and keep in the fridge. To make a tasty iced coffee, use 1 part espresso, 4 parts milk. My husband loves it." - RachelE October 10th, 2015 </blockquote>
			<blockquote>"Yum! We left out the lemon. Why it's even in the recipe, no clue! It's simply not needed. What we did add was just a healthy two-finger pinch of kosher salt. It helps to develop the flavor of the coffee in the short amount of time the grounds are in contact with the hot water as it brews." - asnunez January 20th, 2015 </blockquote>

			<h2>2. Vanilla Latte</h2>

				<li>3 cups milk</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
				<li>2 cups freshly-brewed maxwell house rich dark roast coffee</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>PREPARATION</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Heat milk in small saucepan on low heat until warm, stirring briskly and constantly with wire whisk to create foam.</li>
				<li>Remove from heat; stir in vanilla.</li>

				<li>Serve immediately (they recommend with Nilla wafers).</li>
				<li>Other flavour option: 1/4 teaspoons almond extract instead of vanilla.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>RECIPE REVIEW</h3>
			<blockquote>"I took lemoncurd's advice and changed it up a bit. I like my lattes sweet so I added sugar to taste to my coffee before adding the frothed milk and vanilla. I topped it with a bit a whipped cream. Made this way, it was as good or better than any vanilla latte I've ever had." - wndydgls April 13th, 2015</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"I have been making tea and coffee in this way for some time now. The only difference is I add the coffee or tea to the mug, add sugar to taste and then top up with the vanilla flavoured foamed milk. For a specail drink try it with vanilla flavoured tea bag or honey vanilla tea bag. This makes a delicious and comforting drink." - lemoncurd June 7th, 2006</blockquote>

			<h2>4. Mango Lassi</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
				<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
				<li>1 cup chopped very ripe mango, or a cup of canned mango pulp</li>
				<li>4 teaspoons honey or sugar, more or less to taste</li>

				<li>Ice (optional)</li>

				<li>If you want a more milkshake consistency and it's a hot day, either blend in some ice as well or serve over ice cubes.</li>
				<li>Sprinkle with a tiny pinch of ground cardamom to serve.</li>
				<li>The lassi can be kept refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>NOTA BENE</h3>
			<h3>RECIPE REVIEW</h3>
			<blockquote>"I followed the recipe except used almond milk and added a little saffron. My mango is frozen and really good – tastes almost like fresh when thawed. I didn’t add any sugar as I find the natural sweetness of the mango was enough for me (I don’t like too sweet and am trying to cut out sugar as much as possible). Very refreshing and delicious on a hot day." - Moira July 21st, 2016</blockquote>
			<blockquote>"I’ve only read about half of the comments, so possibly someone has already said this in the part I didn’t get to, but I have made many mango lassis using all different recipes and variations, and I’ve found that BY FAR, the very best ones are made with *frozen* mango that you can usually buy in 1 lb (16 oz) bags at the supermarket year-round. Not only does it purée much more easily in the blender with no pieces left, it is also completely free of that chalky taste/feel that you often get with fresh mangoes if they’re not perfectly precisely ripe. AND it ensures that your drink comes out very cold and stays cold for a long time if you like to sip it slowly (warm lassi is grrrroooossss)!Anyway, FROZEN FRUIT is the key to cold, smooth, refreshing mango perfection! - Gillian Zyland September 26th, 2016"</blockquote>
